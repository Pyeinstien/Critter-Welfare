<P>
    <BR><B>Itchy or dry skin</B><BR>

    Powder up sugar-free oatmeal, make a paste and apply on affected areas. Rinse after 10-15 minutes. You can even mix the oatmeal formula with warm water and let them soak in it for 5-10 minutes.
    
    Powder up sugar-free oatmeal, make a paste and apply on affected areas. Rinse after 10-15 minutes. You can even mix the oatmeal formula with warm water and let them soak in it for 5-10 minutes.
    
    Preventive Tip: Don’t give them frequent baths as they might remove the natural oils from their skin, making it dry.
    
    <BR><B>Diarrhea</B><BR>
    Chamomile tea helps to decrease the inflammation of the stomach and their intestinal lining. Add it to their food or water for easy ingestion.
    
    Plain yogurt without artificial sugars or other additional ingredients is another great option. Do note though that this is not suitable for lactose-intolerant or dairy-sensitive dogs.
    
    A little ginger and honey will also give them relief during these times.
    
    Preventive Tip: Keep your pets well-exercised, give them fresh food, and ensure their vaccinations are updated.
    
    <BR><B>Ear infection</B><BR>
    Try wiping your dog’s ears with a warm damp cloth first. If that doesn’t seem sufficient, dip a cotton ball clean in a solution of apple cider vinegar mixed with water and gently wipe their ears.
    
    As an alternative, you can also use a non-alcoholic cleansing solution.
    
    If there’s no itching and you just wish to clean the wax build up then wipe their ears with some almond oil.
    
    If it looks like they have bites, an intense bad smell, or suspect inflammation, it’s better to consult a vet.
    
    Preventive Tip: Don’t forget to dry your pet’s ears after a bath or romp in the water.
    
    <BR><B>Dental diseases</B><BR>
    Coconut oil is a great anti-bacterial solution and very beneficial when applied on gums.
    
    Aloe vera gel is also found to be soothing in case of dental irritation.
    
    Add Vitamin C rich foods to their diet which will help to reduce swelling or pain in their mouth.
    
    Prepare an eggshell toothpaste using eggshells or calcium tablets, peppermint powder/oil, coconut oil and baking soda.
    
    Preventive Tip: Brush their teeth every single day before they go to sleep and after they have finished their meals for the day. Schedule annual dental checkups even if you don’t see evident problems.
    
    <BR><B> Urinary infection</B><BR>
    The D-mannose sugar in cranberries lowers the pH levels of urine and also prevents the growth of bacteria in urine. Ensure you don’t give them extra sweet cranberry juice which might lead to their weight gain. Confirm with the vet whether your dog can have it.
    
    Apple cider vinegar can be added to their food. For small dogs, add just one teaspoon. For older dogs, 2-3 tablespoons can be added. Add the vinegar to their food twice a day for around 7-10 days depending on the severity of the disease.
    
    If your dog’s pH level is above or below the range 6.5-7, there is potential for some bacterial growth. Balance their pH levels by adding fresh lemon juice to their water. Vitamin C supplements, in small doses, lower their urine pH and prevent bacterial growth in the bladder.
    
    Preventive Tip: When you see early signs of urinary infections, make them rest, regulate their diet, and give them lots of water. Make them urinate as frequently as possible.

<br>
The acidity of cranberries can lower the pH of your cat’s urine, which can help treat a UTI and stop it from coming back. 

<br>
<B>Fleas </B>
<br>
Try mixing the apple cider vinegar with water in a 2:1 ratio and spraying it onto your cat’s coat.
<br>
<B>Tapeworm</B>
<br>
Pumpkin seeds: highly anti-parasitic and full of healthy vitamins and minerals, these seeds can kill both larval and adult tapeworms.
Parsley water: brew a homemade “tea” from the leaves of this herb to give your cat a gentle and natural diuretic.

<br>
Unflavored psyllium (e.g., Metamucil) and canned pumpkin are two easily available fiber supplements
Encourage Water and Electrolyte Intake
